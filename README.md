# Sein

Cosmetic mod for the Custom Knight skin "Ori"

This adds a custom HUD in the style of the Ori games, recasting the Knight's soul and masks as "energy" and "life" respectively, along with various other visual additions not possible through Custom Knight itself.

The mod is intended to be purely cosmetic and not alter any gameplay elements, so should be safe to use in competitive races and tournaments.

## Settings

Various aspects of the mod can be toggled independently for a less extreme overhaul if desired.

-   Hud can be disabled to preserve the classic HK hud
-   Ori SFX can be disabled to preserve HK SFX for some moves
-   Ori's companion orb 'Sein' can be disabled to reduce visual distraction

## Installation

First, install [Custom Knight](https://prashantmohta.github.io/HollowKnight.CustomKnight/user/installing/) following official instructions.

The Ori skin is stored in this repo but Github doesn't provide a way to download directories, use [this link](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdplochcoder%2FHollowKnight.Sein%2Ftree%2Fmain%2FOri) to download instead.  Unzip the resulting zip file into your Skins directory like any other Custom Knight skin.

Finally, install this mod (Sein) via an MK mod installer such as [Lumafly](https://themulhima.github.io/Lumafly/).  It will turn on automatically when you switch to the Ori skin via Custom Knight, and disable itself if you select any other skin.
