# Sein

Cosmetic mod for the Custom Knight skin "Ori"

This adds a custom HUD in the style of the Ori games, recasting the Knight's soul and masks as "energy" and "life" respectively, along with various other visual additions not possible through Custom Knight itself.

The mod is intended to be purely cosmetic and not alter any gameplay elements, so should be safe to use in competitive races and tournaments.

## Settings

Various aspects of the mod can be toggled independently for a less extreme overhaul if desired.

-   Hud can be disabled to preserve the classic HK hud
-   Ori SFX can be disabled to preserve HK SFX for some moves
-   Ori's companion orb 'Sein' can be disabled to reduce visual distraction

## Installation

Install this mod (Sein) via an HK mod installer such as [Lumafly](https://themulhima.github.io/Lumafly/). The Ori skin is embedded automatically in it, and will be available for selection from the CustomKnight menu.

If you don't want the skin to be named "Ori", you can edit the globalsettings.json for the Sein mod to change this name.
